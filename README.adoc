# Adjudication API Server

## Project Setup

We do not have a company maven repository yet so you will need to install all
custom (internal company, GDPR, etc.) dependencies by checking out the source
of any internal modules, changing into their root, and running:

    mvn clean install

This will put them in your local maven repo cache on your machine.

### Axon GDPR encryption

We use a licensed Axon library that has to be installed locally in your machine
in order for the build to work.  There are shell scripts (and windows .cmd)
scripts provided to install them locally.  Here are the commands:

Install Axon GDPR core support:

    # From the project root directory
    cd axon-gdpr-distrib/versions/core
    ./install.sh # or run the cmd

Install Axon 3 support:

    # From the project root directory
    cd axon-gdpr-distrib/versions/axon3
    ./install.sh # or run the cmd

## Bulding the project

The project must build and run on the Linux command line.  From the root project directory:

    mvn clean install
    # OR
    mvn -P mariadb4j clean install

### Database support

We currently have support for two embedded databases in order to ease testing:  mariadb and h2.

To enable build support for mariadb you must use the maven profile "mariadb4j" e.g.

    # From the root directory
    mvn -P mariadb4j clean install

## Running the project

You must activate the appropriate spring profiles during the run command to select the database
config to use and other properties.  For example, from the root directory (after building the
project) execute:

    java -Dspring.profiles.active=<comma separated list of profiles> -jar boot-server/target/adjudication-api-server-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

The profiles are described below:

. dev - basic common dev settings
. h2db - use the embedded H2 database
. mariadb4j - use the embedded mariadb4j database
. nosecurity - disable API security (to ease some testing)
. internal - to enable a testing controller that lets you issue some commands to create data etc.

So to run the program in dev mode with mariadb4j database, disabled API security, and be able to hit the test controller:

    # Note: must have been compiled with the "mariadb4j" maven profile
    java -Dspring.profiles.active=dev,mariadb4j,nosecurity,internal -jar boot-server/target/bc-api-server-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
